V1, stands for Version1 and it is the first attempt to run LD score regression. It was run only on some of the summary stats.
And it was meant to try the package and learn the basics. There might be some misinterpretation on the A1 and A2 alleles. 

V2, is like version 1, but with differen traits. Especially armfat was added as we knew from the literature the heritability and we
used it as control that everyhting in the code was ok. There might be some misinterpretation on the A1 and A2 alleles. 

V3 is the propper analysis from the summary statistic until the GWAS with the factors. A1 and A2 alleles, manually checked on the papers. 
This version is the one we work on. 

V4 is the harmonized one. Meaning that the analysis is a LD score regression and nothing more, however with the harmonized summary statistics.
Harmonized means that I downloaded the harmonzied summary statistis, that are the one in a common format uplodaed in GWAScatalog. 
The results were consistent with the non harmonized.
It was not used to further anlaysis.
