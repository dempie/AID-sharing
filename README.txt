AID_sharing project

contributors: Pietro Demela, Nicola Pirastu, Blagoje Soskic

The aim of the project is to use structural equation modelling to model the polygenic structure of autoimmune diseases.
The package that will be used is GenomicSEM, https://github.com/GenomicSEM/GenomicSEM, that allows this.

This is the home directory of the project and here is a description of what is contained in each folder. 

   a) ldscores/ a folder downloaded as described by the github of genomicSEM, that contains the LD scores from HapMap3, DO NOT MODIFY ANITHING. 
   b) outputs/ all the outputs will be inside this folder in subfolders according to the version. 
   c) Prevalences/ this folder contains CSV files that I have generated by reading the papers of the GWAS. Each CSV contains the sample prevalence for eanch cohort in the                       GWAS. It's necessary to calculate the sample effictive sample size. Details in the github of the package. 
   d) renv/ the folder that the package renv generates to keep track of the package versions. No need to open it. Very important to know how renv works!
   e) Sripts/ contains the code that I wrote, and here the anlysis is conducted. 
   f) SNP/ contains a reference file of the rsID needed by the package, info in the github of genomicSEM. Used by me also to add rsID to summary stats. 
   g) Summary_Stats/ contains the the raw summary_stats downloaded from the papers, (mostly by GWAScatalog)
   h) loci_definitions/ is the first version of the defiontion of the loci with conditional analysis and colocalization (the table final_locus_table.tsv is identical to the second version in       Nicola/)
   i) Nicola/ folder contains the latest version of final_locus_table.tsv (even if it is identical to the loci_definitions/final_locus_table.tsv described in point  h)). It also contains the       results of the latest sc_eQtl analysis
